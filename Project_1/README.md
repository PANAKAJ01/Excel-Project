> An Excel project demonstrating data extraction and analysis using **VLOOKUP**, **INDEX-MATCH**, **SUMIF/SUMIFS**, and visualizing insights tailored to a Coffee Shop scenario.

---

##  Project Overview

In this project (located here: `Project_1/V lookup,Sumifs,Index.xlsx`), I built an Excel-based analytics tool for a **Coffee Shop**—focusing on:

- Retrieving specific data using **VLOOKUP** and **INDEX-MATCH**
- Generating aggregated insights using **SUMIF** and **SUMIFS**
- Presenting insights via a dynamic **dashboard** (sales performance, top products, revenue trends)

---

##  Formulas & Techniques Used

I used the following Excel functions to implement the project:

| Function       | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VLOOKUP`      | Fetch product or category data from structured tables                   |
| `INDEX`/`MATCH`| Advanced lookups for better flexibility and error control               |
| `SUMIF`        | Sum data based on a single condition (e.g. total sales per product)     |
| `SUMIFS`       | Sum data with multiple conditions (e.g. product sales by month/category)|
| Core Formulas  | `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT` for basic aggregates                         |
| Charts / Dashboard | Visual analysis of trends, comparisons, and KPIs                   |

##  Dashboard Highlights

While the `.xlsx` workbook contains multiple sheets, the centerpiece is the **Dashboard**, which includes:

- **Sales Insights**: Daily/weekly/monthly revenue totals and trends
- **Top Performers**: Identifies best-selling products and categories
- **Revenue Comparison**: Side-by-side monthly or product comparisons
- **Dynamic Charts**: Interactive visuals that update as data changes

*(Screenshot placeholders can be added for a visual preview.)*
